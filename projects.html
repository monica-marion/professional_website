<p>How and why do storytellers return to the same stories and tropes across time? What is the role of the "collective" or "traditional" in telling different kinds of stories? What is the role of magic, marvel, and wonder in narrative?</p>

             Folktales, Narrative, and Tradition
            </h2>
            <p>Because of the push and pull between tradition and innovation in folk and fairy tales, stories are repeated across generations and subtly altered by subsequent tellers, creating threads of consistency and change that only appear at the broad, comparative scale. Artists, communities, and corporations draw on past understanding of "the folktale" when they reframe and reperform these stories.

             Genre Landscapes
            </h2>
            <p>Genres serve as storytelling tools, but genre categories are constantly challenged by different categorization systems, hybrid, outlying, and overlapping stories. Computational embeddings, especially as shaped for computational linguistics and biology, can help visualize some of these complexities. By mapping features of narratives into a vector space, stories' relationships can be depicted in three dimensional space.

             Community Archive Architecture
            </h2>
            <p>Currently, a significant portion of local, personal, and community archiving happens on social media platforms. These platforms, not built for archival purposes, exacerbate issues of ownership, preservation, and access. Other resources, including open-source software, can be used to build small archiving projects. However, such systems tend to focus on preservation rather than sharing or exhibition, which is often the primary purpose of digitizing. This project works to create prototype online folklore collections, encompassing the entire data pipeline, from material object, through collection, to online sharing.

             The Outcomes of Interdisciplinary Training and Scholarship
            </h2>
            <p>Recently, a trend towards data-driven social science, and the availability of massive amounts of cultural data on the Internet, has increased interdisciplinary research on cultural topics. A push for problem-driven science has also increased institutional calls for interdisciplinary science. However, because of the very different frameworks and metaphors at play across disciplines, interdisciplinary researchers face systematic obstacles.

             Folklore, Community, and the Early Internet
            </h2>
           <p>While today's Internet is global, enormous, and omnipresent, computer networks fifty years ago were small, subcultural, and a particularly USAmerican phenomenon. However, early forays into computer communication were an important precursor to the Internet as we know it. Public archives of some of the oldest online communities, like UseNet, newsgroups, bulletin boards, and their associated mailing lists, have been preserved by institutions and community members, but gathering metaphorical dust since the mid-1990s. As computers have become more powerful and more essential in the past few decades, scientists have developed new tools that more accurately parse and model large amounts of unstructured text. Turning these methods towards the analysis of "historical" online communities could provide valuable insight.
